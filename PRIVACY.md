# Privacy Policy

**Last updated: January 18, 2025**

## Simple Summary

CoverMe keeps all your data on your computer. We never see your resume, job searches, or personal information. The only data that leaves your computer is job descriptions sent to Google's AI for analysis - and Google doesn't store that data either.

## What Data We Collect and How We Use It

### Data Stored Locally on Your Computer

- Your resume text (stored in Chrome's encrypted local storage)
- Skills extracted from your resume
- Experience level and preferences
- All stored locally, never transmitted to external servers

**Job Analysis History:**
- Job postings you analyze
- Chat conversations about specific jobs
- Usage analytics (how many API calls you make)
- All stored locally on your computer

**Browser Data:**
- Extension settings and preferences
- Keyword management choices
- Ignored skills list
- All stored in Chrome's secure local storage

### Data Sent to External Services

## Data Retention

## Children's Privacy

CoverMe is designed for job seekers and is not intended for users under 13 years old. We do not knowingly collect data from children.

## Your California Privacy Rights

If you're a California resident, you have the right to:
- Know what personal information we collect (see above - it's all stored locally)
- Delete your personal information (use the clear data feature in settings)
- Export your personal information (use the export feature in settings)

Since all data is stored locally on your computer, you have complete control over your information at all times.

---

**Bottom Line:** CoverMe is built on a privacy-first philosophy. Your career data stays yours, on your computer, under your control. We only use external services (Google AI) when you explicitly request job analysis, and that data isn't stored permanently by Google either.
